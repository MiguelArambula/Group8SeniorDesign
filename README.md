Project PhatLab (Temp Title)
=========================================
*Note: I am leaving the Group Title and Project Title for Jake to edit.*  
**Project Title:** *PhatLab (* ***Really*** *Temp Title)*  
**Group Title:** *Team 4-bits of 8 (* ***Really*** *Temp Title)*

**Project Description:**  
  The *[Insert Epic Project Name Here]* is an on-the-fly mobile music workstation that runs on Andriod, with the goal of providing an easy yet effective way of capturing musical inspiration. This project does not aim to become a platform for production-level exports, but rather a means to act as a relatively quick compositional tool and/or loop station, the later only if time permits.  
  
  This piece of software will contain a means to loop audio samples that are placed via a sequencer, an interactive sample pad where you can trigger samples using touch, as well as a means to record and insert personal audio samples. We are aiming for an intuative and effective interface that splits the screen into a **local** and **global** interface, the local interface switching between the sequencer and trigger pads, while the global interface handles items such as BMP and other project-related settings.
  
**Important Files / Documents:**
* N/A

=========================================
***For Reference:***
* **Source:** This is where you should place all of your source code.  If your project
  uses multiple languages, you may find it useful to have subdirectories, e.g.,
  Source/java, Source/html, Source/images, etc.  If you are using an IDE that has
  a project directory, you may wish to start the project here.  For example, the
  Source directory could contain an Xcode project repository or a VisualStudio
  project.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.  This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company.  That is a good example of what a requirements document for this
  class should look like.

* **Resources:** This is where you can place files that are useful to your project.
  For example, you may place here helpful articles downloaded from the internet.

**Project elements can change int he future, but warn Gamboa of any substantive changes.**

This file should also give him a good description of the files and folders that you want 
him to look for grading purposes.  For example, if your code is in Java, you may describe 
the most important Java packages and the order in which he should view them to understand 
your code.  He will probably take a look at everything that is in the repository, but your
guidance will make it easier for him to navigate the project. [Gamboa]
